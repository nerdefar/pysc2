nerdefar's pysc2

-An ambitious hobby project to create a self learning Sc2 bot
- The goal is to learn more machine learning, as well as ReactJS and ASP.NET MVC.
- The bot will send data to a server which will update information on a website
- Due to hardware limitations the training process will have to be linked up to a cloud service, hopefully Azure if possible.

Sub-Goals:
- Create a scripted Sc2 bot to become familiar with the pysc2 framework.
	- Currently in progress.
- Create a trainable sc2 bot which performs actions by itself.
- Extend the trainable class to allow a model to be saved, reloaded and further trained.
- Set up a data stream from the bot to the ASP.NET backend
- Create basic react components to update a website depending on info sent from the bot.
- Sync training with a cloud service to increase training efficiency. (Possibly feasibility..).
- Improvements of bot, data flow and visualization.

Libraries and frameworks:
-Keras
-TensorFlow
-ReactJS
-ASP.NET MVC
-Microsoft Azure(?)
-Eventual..
